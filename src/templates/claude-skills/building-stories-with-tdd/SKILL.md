## 🚨 GOLDEN RULES: API-First Testing 🚨

**READ THIS BEFORE WRITING ANY TEST!**

### Rule 1: Test Through API Only

**Tests MUST go through REST/GraphQL interfaces using TestHelper. Direct Service or Database access in test logic makes tests WORTHLESS.**

**Why this rule is absolute:**
- **Security**: Direct Service calls bypass authentication, authorization, guards, decorators
- **Reality**: Tests must verify what actual users experience through the API
- **Worthless**: Tests bypassing the API cannot catch real bugs in the security layer

**✅ ALWAYS:**
- Use `testHelper.rest()` for REST endpoints
- Use `testHelper.graphQl()` for GraphQL operations
- Test the complete chain: API → Guards → Service → Database

**❌ NEVER:**
- Call Services directly: `userService.create()` ❌
- Query DB in tests: `db.collection('users').findOne()` ❌
- Mock Controllers/Resolvers ❌

**🔓 Only Exception: Setup/Cleanup**
- Setting roles: `db.collection('users').updateOne({ _id: id }, { $set: { roles: ['admin'] } })` ✅
- Setting verified: `db.collection('users').updateOne({ _id: id }, { $set: { verified: true } })` ✅
- Cleanup: `db.collection('entities').deleteMany({ createdBy: userId })` ✅

### Rule 2: Verify Before Assuming

**NEVER assume endpoints, methods, or properties exist - ALWAYS verify by reading the actual code!**

**✅ BEFORE writing tests:**
- Read Controller files to verify endpoints exist
- Read Resolver files to verify GraphQL operations exist
- Read existing tests to understand patterns
- Document what you verified with file references

**✅ BEFORE implementing:**
- Read Service files to verify method signatures
- Read Model files to verify properties and types
- Read CrudService base class to understand inherited methods
- Check actual code, don't assume!

**❌ NEVER:**
- Assume an endpoint exists without reading the controller ❌
- Assume a method signature without reading the service ❌
- Guess property names without reading the model ❌

## Core TDD Workflow - The Seven Steps

**📖 Complete workflow details: `workflow.md`**

**Process:** Step 1 (Analysis) → Step 2 (Create Test) → Step 3 (Run Tests) → [Step 3a: Fix Tests if needed] → Step 4 (Implement) → Step 5 (Validate) → Step 5a (Quality Check) → Step 5b (Final Validation)

---

### Step 1: Story Analysis & Validation
**📖 Details: `workflow.md` → Step 1**

- Read story, verify existing API structure (read Controllers/Resolvers)
- Document what exists vs what needs creation
- Ask for clarification if ambiguous (use AskUserQuestion)

### Step 2: Create Story Test
**📖 Details: `workflow.md` → Step 2**

**🚨 CRITICAL: Test through API only - NEVER direct Service/DB access!**

- ✅ Use `testHelper.rest()` or `testHelper.graphQl()`
- ❌ NEVER call Services directly or query DB in test logic
- 🔓 Exception: Direct DB access ONLY for setup/cleanup (roles, verified status)

**Test Data Rules (parallel execution):**
1. Emails MUST end with `@test.com` (use: `user-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8)}@test.com`)
2. Never reuse data across test files
3. Only delete entities created in same test file
4. Implement complete cleanup in `afterAll`

### Step 3: Run Tests & Analyze
**📖 Details: `workflow.md` → Step 3**

```bash
npm test  # Or: npm test -- tests/stories/your-story.story.test.ts
```

**Decide:** Test bugs → Step 3a | Implementation missing → Step 4

### Step 3a: Fix Test Errors
**📖 Details: `workflow.md` → Step 3a**

Fix test logic/errors. NEVER "fix" by removing security. Return to Step 3 after fixing.

### Step 4: Implement/Extend API Code
**📖 Details: `workflow.md` → Step 4**

**Use `generating-nest-servers` skill for:** Module/object creation, understanding existing code

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Property Descriptions:** Format as `ENGLISH (GERMAN)` when user provides German comments
2. **ServiceOptions:** Only pass what's needed (usually just `currentUser`), NOT all options
3. **Guards:** DON'T add `@UseGuards(AuthGuard(...))` - automatically activated by `@Roles()`
4. **Database indexes:** Define in @UnifiedField decorator (see `database-indexes.md`)

### Step 5: Validate & Iterate
**📖 Details: `workflow.md` → Step 5**

```bash
npm test
```

✅ All pass → Step 5a | ❌ Fail → Return to Step 3

### Step 5a: Code Quality & Refactoring Check
**📖 Details: `workflow.md` → Step 5a**

Review: Code quality (`code-quality.md`), Database indexes (`database-indexes.md`), Security (`security-review.md`). Run tests after changes.

### Step 5b: Final Validation
**📖 Details: `workflow.md` → Step 5b**

Run all tests, verify quality checks, generate final report. DONE! 🎉

## 🔄 Handling Existing Tests When Modifying Code

**📖 Complete details: `handling-existing-tests.md`**

**When your changes break existing tests:**
- Intentional change? → Update tests + document why
- Unclear? → Investigate with git (`git show HEAD`, `git diff`), fix to satisfy both old & new tests

**Remember:** Existing tests document expected behavior - preserve backward compatibility!

---

## ⛔ CRITICAL: GIT COMMITS

**🚨 NEVER create git commits unless explicitly requested by the developer.**

Your responsibility:
- ✅ Create/modify files, run tests, provide comprehensive report
- ❌ **NEVER commit to git without explicit request**

You may remind in final report: "Implementation complete - review and commit when ready."

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY RULES

**📖 Complete details: `security-review.md`**

### ⛔ NEVER:
- Remove/weaken `@Restricted()` or `@Roles()` decorators
- Modify `securityCheck()` to bypass security
- Add `@UseGuards(AuthGuard(...))` manually (automatically activated by `@Roles()`)

### ✅ ALWAYS:
- Analyze existing security before writing tests
- Create appropriate test users with correct roles
- Test with least-privileged users
- Ask before changing ANY security decorator

**When tests fail due to security:** Create proper test users with appropriate roles, NEVER remove security decorators.

## Code Quality Standards

**📖 Complete details: `code-quality.md`**

**Must follow:**
- File organization, naming conventions, import statements from existing code
- Error handling and validation patterns
- Use @lenne.tech/nest-server first, add packages as last resort

**Test quality:**
- 80-100% coverage, self-documenting, independent, repeatable, fast

**🚨 NEVER use `declare` keyword** - it prevents decorators from working!

## Autonomous Execution

**Work autonomously:** Create tests, run tests, fix code, iterate Steps 3-5, use nest-server-generator skill

**Only ask when:** Story ambiguous, security changes needed, new packages, architectural decisions, persistent failures

## Final Report

When all tests pass, provide comprehensive report including:
- Story name, tests created (location, count, coverage)
- Implementation summary (modules/objects/properties created/modified)
- Test results (all passing, scenarios summary)
- Code quality (patterns followed, security preserved, dependencies, refactoring, indexes)
- Security review (auth/authz, validation, data exposure, ownership, injection prevention, errors, security tests)
- Files modified (with changes description)
- Next steps (recommendations)

## Common Patterns

**📖 Complete patterns and examples: `examples.md` and `reference.md`**

**Study existing tests first!** Common patterns:
- Create test users via `/auth/signin`, set roles/verified via DB
- REST requests: `testHelper.rest('/api/...', { method, payload, token, statusCode })`
- GraphQL queries: `testHelper.graphQl({ name, type, arguments, fields }, { token })`
- Test organization: `describe` blocks for Happy Path, Error Cases, Edge Cases

## Integration with generating-nest-servers

**During Step 4 (Implementation), use `generating-nest-servers` skill for:**
- Module creation (`lt server module`)
- Object creation (`lt server object`)
- Adding properties (`lt server addProp`)
- Understanding existing code (Services, Controllers, Resolvers, Models, DTOs)

**Best Practice:** Invoke skill for NestJS component work rather than manual editing.

## Remember

1. Tests first, code second - write tests before implementation
2. Iterate until green - all tests must pass
3. Security review mandatory - check before final tests
4. Refactor before done - extract common functionality
5. Security is sacred - never compromise for passing tests
6. Quality over speed - good tests and clean code
7. Ask when uncertain - clarify early
8. Autonomous execution - work independently, report comprehensively
9. Match existing patterns - equivalent implementation
10. Clean up test data - comprehensive cleanup in afterAll

**Goal:** Deliver fully tested, high-quality, maintainable, secure features that integrate seamlessly with existing codebase.
